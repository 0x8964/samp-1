## Build Instructions
- Load samp.sln. (Project is being developed using VS 2013 so anything more later than that should also work.)
- Then build! (Prefferbly with debug mode being as crashes can occur.)

## Client Issues
- You cannot move. Unknown what is causing this. see [#4](https://github.com/J0shES/samp/issues/4)
- Some issues with scoreboard not recieving score/player names properly. [#7](https://github.com/J0shES/samp/issues/7)
- SetPlayerWaypoint is not working correctly. [#8](https://github.com/J0shES/samp/issues/8)
- Client crashes on load, this is fixed by renaming your original main.scm to something else then moving the main.scm file from the project directory to SA_ROOT/data/scripts/.

## Server Issues
- N/A
